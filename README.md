# 🧾 Invoice Management System

A **web application** that allows an admin to **add users and their purchase details**, store them in a **PostgreSQL database**, and generate **invoices as PDFs**. The system ensures that:
- **New users are created** when adding their first purchase.
- **Existing users have their new purchases appended** to their history.
- Users can **view their purchase history** and **download an invoice** as a PDF.
- A **navigation bar** allows switching between adding purchases and viewing history.
